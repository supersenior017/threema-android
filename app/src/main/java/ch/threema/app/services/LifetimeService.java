 * If there are 1 or more slots open, then a connection is kept open, otherwise it is closed.
 *
 * In some situations we want to stop the connection even if the counter is >0,
 * for example when the device is going to deep sleep. For this, the {@link #pause()}
 * and {@link #unpause()} methods can be used.
 *
 * If you want to acquire a connection that should not be pauseable (e.g. for the Threema Push
 * service), then set the `unpauseable` flag (or use {@link #acquireUnpauseableConnection(String)})
 * when acquiring the connection.

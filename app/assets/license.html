<p>curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function</p>

<p>http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/</p>

<p>Adam Langley agl@imperialviolet.org</p>

<p>Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein djb@cr.yp.to</p>

<p>More information about curve25519 can be found here http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</p>

<p>djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly language called qhasm
    and uses the floating point registers.</p>

<p>This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It uses many of the
    tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken from the sample implementation.</p>

<p><strong><a name="no-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</a></strong>. In no event and
    under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p><strong><a name="add-liability">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</a></strong>.
    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
    not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
    asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty
    or additional liability.</p>
